export const description=`I am Hong Kien. I just graduated Bachelor of Business and Information Technology,
 majoring in Software Development and Accounting from Monash University. I am well-versed in developing 
 specifications and requirements, designing software applications, and database structuring.I am a passionate
  and creative problem solver, with high responsibility for the tasks that I am allocated to. During my education,
   I gain knowledge not only in programming aspects but also in the business aspect, because I believe a developer
    should also have an understanding of business aspects such as the scope of budget, revenue generation expectation,
     ...etc. These gave me the technical knowledge and real-world experience required to excel in this role. During my
      course of study, I demonstrated my creativity and problem-solving skills to deliver sophisticated software solutions.
       My experience working on my own projects in a team environment has shown my ability to work collaboratively,
        foster a capacity for creative problem-solving, and take ownership of projects. I am not afraid of challenges
         or taking on full responsibility for the task and I will always try to learn and improve myself day by day.`;
